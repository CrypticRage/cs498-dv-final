    <h1>The 498 Conundrum</h1>
    <p>Over the last three years I've completed six classes at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (pronounced
      like "ban" in the middle), clawing my way towards a computer science degree. God willing and the creek don't
      rise, a decent grade on this project will
      wrap up my seventh class, leaving me with one final class to push through.</p>
    <p>I've had a bad case of what I'll call impostor syndrome or genius envy ever since I started this program. My gut
    simply told me that everyone else got excellent grades with little effort, and that my struggles were unique. My
    brain has occasionally pushed back with a bit of logic and reason, but to no avail.</p>
    <p>One side effect of all this nonsense has been an slight obsession with my GPA and grades in general. "Good data
    can cut through any amount of emotional noise", I thought, so I asked a simple question.<b> How well do people actually do in all these
        classes?</b> A few Google searches led me to the answer:</p>
    <div class="ui raised segment">
      <h3><a href="http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa_of_every_course_at_illinois/">GPAs of Every Course at The
        University of Illinois</a></h3>
    <p>In July 2016, the University of Illinois responded to a Freedom of Information Act request
      (FOIA #16-456 and others) for "the grade distributions by percent and/or letter grade, for every class [...]
      at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign".</p>
    <p>This dataset, now available on github, contains the breakdown
      of GPA for every course at The University of Illinois. As noted in the FOIA response, some data was withheld to
      maintain FERPA compliance.</p>
