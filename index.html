    <h1>Good Grades & The 498 Conundrum</h1>
  </div>
  <div id="page" class="ui main text container vertical aligned segment">
    <p>Over the last two years I've completed six classes at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (pronounced
      like "ban" in the middle), clawing my way towards a Master's in computer science. Finishing this project will
      wrap up my seventh class, leaving me with one final class to finish. I've had a bad case of what I'll call
      impostor syndrome or genius envy ever since I started this program. The irrational part of my brain tells me that
      my struggles with the workload are unique, and that everyone else gets perfect grades with little effort.</p>
    <p>One side effect of all this nonsense has been a slight obsession with my GPA and grades in general. At some point
      during my second year I reasoned that "good data can cut through any amount of noise", so I asked
      a simple question:</p><p><b>How well do people actually do in all these classes? Or, to put it more like a data scientist,
  what are the grade distributions for all the classes in the computer science curriculum?</b></p>
      <p>A few Google searches led me to the answer:</p>
    <div class="ui raised segment">
      <h3><a href="http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/gpa_of_every_course_at_illinois/">GPAs of Every Course at The
        University of Illinois</a></h3>
    <p>In July 2016, the University of Illinois responded to a Freedom of Information Act request
      (FOIA #16-456 and others) for "the grade distributions by percent and/or letter grade, for every class [...]
      at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign".</p>
    <p>This dataset, now available on github, contains the breakdown
      of GPA for every course at The University of Illinois. As noted in the FOIA response, some data was withheld to
      maintain FERPA compliance.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This is a fascinating dataset that contains grade distributions for every class taught at
    Illinois over the last decade. The visualization, which I'll call the "circle graph", is also impressive. It provides a bird's-eye view of
    the average number of students enrolled in each class per year, along with the average GPA. Being a computer science
    student, I immediately moused over the entire range of CS classes. It didn't hurt that our classes
    are in the first row.</p>
    <img class="ui large centered image" src="./img/cs-400-classes.png">
    <div class="ui divider"></div>
    <img class="ui medium centered image" src="./img/cs-498.png">
    <p>When I got to the end of the row and moused over CS498, three things immediately occurred to me:</p>
    <div class="ui ordered list">
      <div class="item"><p>Applied Cryptography sounds complicated, but the average GPA is pretty high. I should do a little research on it.</p></div>
      <div class="item"><p>I'm pretty sure Applied Cryptography isn't the only class designated CS498 in the computer
        science curriculum.</p></div>
      <div class="item"><p>There is a <b>zero percent chance</b> that over <b>2,400 people</b> take that
        class every year (on average).</p></div>
    </div>
    <p>This prompted my second big question:</p>
    <p><b>What's going on here? Where are the rest of the CS498 classes?</b></p>
    <p>I'll attempt to answer this question before circling back to the first question about grades.</p>
    <p>First, we need to take a look at how the dataset is structured. Every section, of every
      class, in every semester from the Spring of 2010 to the Winter of 2019/2020 has a record in the dataset
      represented by a row in a CSV file. Each row has a bunch of columns containing useful fields. Each field is
      described below:</p>
    <table class="ui celled padded table">
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="single line">Column #</th>
        <th class="single line">Field Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr></thead>
      <tbody>

        <td class="single line">
          Course Title

        <td>The full name of the class. "Applied Cryptography", for example.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>7 - 20</td>
        <td class="single line">
          "A+" to "W"
        </td>
        <td>Each of these columns has a count of the number of people who received that grade.<br>
        A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-<br>C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, W</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>21</td>
        <td class="single line">
          Primary Instructor
        </td>
        <td>The primary instructor of each class. Instructors can have multiple sections in a given
        semester.</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Before we dig into the data, lets reference the following blurb is from the page hosting the dataset and the circle graph:</p>
    <div class="ui raised segment"><p>The page is the result of the work of one team of students' work on this GPA
      dataset, using data from <b>Fall 2016 through Winter 2019/20</b>.</p></div>
    <p>Given that range, let's start with a few assumptions. First, in order to generate the CS498 circle on the graph, let's assume that
      the data has been filtered by the year range (2016-2019), then the subject (CS), and finally the number (498).</p>
    <p>Next, we'll assume that if multiple courses in a subject match this filter, their total enrollment would be aggregated in one sum.
      That sum would then be divided by the number of years in the range (4) to find the average.</p>
    <p>Finally, the result would be labeled with whatever class title showed up first. For CS498, if we assume the classes were sorted
      alphabetically, it's also reasonable to assume that "Applied Cryptography" would be at the top of the list.</p>
    <p>Let's test those assumptions and look at some data:</p>
    <div id="graph1Container" class="ui"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Graph 1 shows the total number of students who took any CS498 class for each year those classes were
      available.</p>
    <p>Here we can see that our original assumption is incorrect.
    No single year crosses the 2,000 mark for enrollment, much less the average since 2016.</p>
    <div id="graph2Container" class="ui"></div>
    <br>
    <p>As a sanity check, we can look at the enrollment for all 400 level CS classes in Graph 2. We're now
      well above the expected average of 2,400, but the exact answer still eludes us and lies somewhere in the middle.
      I didn't have much time to look at the original author's code, unfortunately, so for this
      project it will stay a mystery.</p>
    <p>What about the assumption that "Applied Cryptography" is first in a list of classes sorted alphabetically? If we
      filter the data to only include CS498 classes taught from 2016 to 2019, we can sort them by year, then alphabetically,
      to get our answer:</p>
<div class="ui message"><pre><code class="javascript">filteredData = data
  .filter(d => d["Subject"] === "CS")
  .filter(d => d["Number"] === 498)
  .filter(d => d["Year"] >= 2016);

sortedData = filteredData.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a["Year"] === b["Year"]) {
    return a["Course Title"] > b["Course Title"] ? 1 : -1;
  }
  else return a["Year"] < b["Year"] ? 1 : -1;
});</code></pre></div>
    <div class="ui message"><pre><code class="javascript">0: "Algorithms for Big Data"
<b>1: "Applied Cryptography"</b>
2: "Applied Machine Learning
...</code></pre></div>
    <p>Wrong again. We're two for two. :)</p>
    <p>Finally, just out of curiosity, I wanted to graph the number of students who actually did enroll in Applied Cryptography
    ever year that its been available. To my surprise, this didn't actually require a graph. Applied Cryptography was only offered
    in the Fall of 2019. A grand total of <b>25 people</b> took the class. Instead, lets take a look at the grade distribution for
    that semester, and circle back to my original question.</p>
    <img class="ui massive centered image" src="./img/cs-498-ac.png">
    <p>Here we get another discrepancy with the original circle chart. The average GPA listed was <b>3.63</b>, while the actual
    average GPA for the single semester is closer to <b>3.24</b>.</p>
    <p>I very much appreciate the original author's work, and acknowledge that the quantity of classes labeled 498 in the
      CS curriculum is puzzling. That count has also increased dramatically over the last decade. When developing a course visualization
      that includes the entire catalog at UIUC, it's easy to overlook one class. I was also inspired to recreate and expand
      the original circle graph to help answer my first question:</p>
    <p><b>How well do people actually do in all these classes?</b></p>
    <p>For that, we need a more interactive version of the "circle graph" that includes the ability to see the grade distributions
      for each class in a chart similar to the one shown for Applied Cryptography, which ended up being the bulk of the work for
      this project. Smash the button below if you're curious:</p>
